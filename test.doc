✅ 1. 1963 – The Studebaker Collapse

Correct — the Studebaker auto company’s pension failure (workers lost benefits) became the trigger for government action.

It exposed that there were no rules forcing companies to fund or secure pensions.

✅ 2. 1974 – ERISA Introduced

Correct — U.S. Congress passed ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) in 1974.

Purpose: protect employees’ retirement money and make pension/retirement systems legally safe.

ERISA brought:

Legal standards for retirement plans (funding, reporting, fiduciary rules).

PBGC (Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) – to insure Defined Benefit pensions if employers went bankrupt.

IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts) – so individuals could save for retirement even without an employer plan.

✅ So yes — both PBGC and IRAs were created under ERISA.

✅ 3. Two Major Plan Types Introduced (You got this right)
Defined Benefit → Employer promises payout
Example Plans	Description
Pension Plan	Monthly fixed benefit after retirement
Cash Balance Plan	Hybrid DB plan (individual balance with guaranteed interest)
(You can also include:)	Annuity-style employer pension plans
Defined Contribution → Employee contributes, benefit depends on investments
Employer-based	Individual-based
401(k), 403(b), 457(b), SIMPLE IRA, SEP IRA	Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, SIMPLE IRA, SEP IRA

✅ Perfect classification — this table is textbook-correct.

✅ 4. 1978 – 401(k) Added by Tax Law

Correct — Section 401(k) was added to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code in 1978.

It allowed employees to defer a part of salary before tax.

Took effect in the early 1980s and became America’s main retirement vehicle.

Alongside:

403(b) → for non-profits / schools

457(b) → for government employees

Traditional IRA → for individuals (from 1974)

Roth IRA → added in 1998 (Taxpayer Relief Act 1997)

SEP IRA → for self-employed / small business owners

SIMPLE IRA → for small employers (<100 employees)

✅ Your mapping of plan types is 100% accurate.

⚙️ 5. Principal’s Timeline (small corrections)
Year	Event
1879	Bankers Life Company founded (Principal’s origin)
1974	ERISA enacted (PGS India came much later — 2006)
Late 1970s – 1980s	Principal started offering IRA and Rollover IRA products
1998	Added Roth IRA options
2018–2019	Launched SimpleInvest, a digital hybrid robo-advisor

✅ Only correction — Principal Global Services (PGS India) wasn’t founded in 1974;
the parent company (Principal Financial Group) existed then,
but PGS India began operations around 2006 in Pune.

✅ 6. SimpleInvest (2018 – 2019)

Perfectly stated:

Principal launched SimpleInvest, an automated (“robo-advice”) platform with two model types:

Time-based investing — allocation shifts with your goal horizon

Risk-based investing — allocation depends on your comfort with volatility

Customers answer a few onboarding questions → system calculates a risk/time score → assigns a PAS-approved model portfolio → invests and rebalances automatically.

🧠 7. Final, KT-Ready One-Liner Summary

“After the Studebaker pension failure in 1963, the U.S. passed the ERISA Act (1974) to protect retirement benefits.
It introduced Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution systems, created the PBGC, and allowed Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).
Later, the 401(k) plan (1978 tax law) became the standard for employer-based savings, while IRAs served individuals.
Principal began offering IRAs in the 1980s, added Roth IRA in 1998, and in 2018 launched SimpleInvest, a hybrid robo-advisor offering time-based and risk-based automated portfolios.”
