<br>
    Principal is a big financial company that helps people and businesses:
    <br>
    Save for retirement
    <br>
    Invest money
    <br>
    Protect wealth through insurance
    <br>
    It runs different services — like helping employees with 401(k)s, offering IRAs to individuals, managing investments, providing banking products, and acting as a trusted custodian for funds.
    <br>
    🧩 2. Business Units & Products
    <br>
    Principal’s work is divided into several parts:
    <br>

    Cash it out (not recommended — taxes + penalties).
    <br>
    🤖 5. Principal SimpleInvest Overview
