    🌍 1. Principal Financial Group Overview

    Principal is a big financial company that helps people and businesses:

    Save for retirement

    Invest money

    Protect wealth through insurance

    It runs different services — like helping employees with 401(k)s, offering IRAs to individuals, managing investments, providing banking products, and acting as a trusted custodian for funds.

    🧩 2. Business Units & Products

    Principal’s work is divided into several parts:

    Workplace Savings (WSRS): Helps companies give retirement benefits like 401(k)s.

    Individual Solutions: Helps regular people invest (e.g., IRA, SimpleInvest).

    Principal Bank: Offers insured savings, CDs, and cash accounts.

    Principal Securities: Handles trading and investment execution.

    Principal Custody Solutions: Keeps investors’ money safe and manages trust accounts.

    Annuities & Pension Transfers: Provides guaranteed income plans for retirees.

    Think of it like:

    👩‍💼 “For employees” → 401(k)
    🧍‍♂️ “For individuals” → IRA / SimpleInvest
    🏦 “For institutions” → Custody / Pension Plans

    📊 3. Retirement Plan Types
    Type    What It Is    Who Uses It
    401(k)    Company-sponsored plan with employer matching    Employees
    IRA    Personal retirement account    Individuals
    SIMPLE IRA    For small companies (≤100 people)    Small business
    SEP IRA    For self-employed    Freelancers / Small biz
    NQDC    Extra savings for executives    Top earners

    🧮 Each has different tax benefits and government rules (ERISA, DOL).

    🔁 4. What Happens When You Change Jobs

    You can:

    Keep your old 401(k).

    Roll it into a Principal IRA or SimpleInvest.

    Move it to your new employer’s plan.

    Cash it out (not recommended — taxes + penalties).

    🤖 5. Principal SimpleInvest Overview

    SimpleInvest is like a smart investment assistant:

    Uses software + human advisors.

    Chooses funds for you based on your age, goals, and risk level.

    Automatically rebalances (adjusts) your portfolio.

    Lets you manage your money through an app or website.

    💡 Example: You roll over your 401(k) → open a SimpleInvest IRA → it keeps growing with automated investments.

    💻 6. Platforms (Who Uses What)
    Platform    User    What They Do
    Client    You    Open account, link bank, invest, withdraw
    Advisor    Financial expert    Manages clients, updates models
    ADO (Admin)    Internal staff    Approves accounts, fixes data
    🧠 7. Key Players in the System

    PAS (Principal Advised Services): Runs portfolios & financial advice.

    PGI (Principal Global Investors): Handles fund investments.

    Apex Custodian: Keeps your assets safe.

    Principal Securities: Executes your trades.

    Principal Bank: Manages cash products.

    Custody Solutions: Provides trust & compliance oversight.

    💰 8. How Principal Makes Money

    Advisory Fees: A small % of assets you invest.

    Account Fees: For maintaining your account.

    Fund Expenses: Part of investment fund costs.

    Interest Spread: On idle cash.

    Custody Fees: For managing large institutional assets.

    ⚙️ 9. Technical Setup (Simplified)

    Frontend: React + NestJS (website you see)

    Backend: Java/Python microservices (business logic)

    AWS Infra: ECS, API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB (cloud setup)

    Security: JWT login, data encryption, role-based access

    Monitoring: CloudWatch, Datadog, Splunk

    It’s built like a modern, cloud-based digital bank and investment app.

    🧱 10. Extended Product Lines (Other Services)

    Principal also manages more than SimpleInvest:

    🔹 Defined Contribution (401k/403b)

    Standard company retirement plans — with investments, education, and tools.

    🔹 Defined Benefit / Pension Transfer

    For big employers who want to transfer pension risk to Principal (Principal pays retirees instead).

    🔹 Stock Plans / ESOP

    Employees get company shares (stock ownership).

    🔹 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation (NQDC)

    Executives save extra money beyond normal limits.

    🔹 Annuities

    Guaranteed monthly income during retirement.

    🔹 Mutual Funds

    Thousands of investment options from Principal & other fund houses.

    🔹 Custody Services

    Principal acts as “guardian” for big institutional investors’ money.

    🧮 11. How It All Connects

    Example flow:

    401(k) → Roll over to IRA → Managed by PAS → Held by Apex → Traded via Principal Securities → Cash handled by Principal Bank.

    That’s the full lifecycle of how your retirement money flows through Principal’s system.

    ⚖️ 12. Compliance & Regulations

    Principal follows strict U.S. financial laws:

    ERISA/DOL → governs retirement plans

    SEC/FINRA → governs trading & investments

    FDIC/SIPC → protects cash/investments

    AML/KYC → ensures security and prevents fraud

    🧭 13. Presentation Output

    A 15–20 slide PowerPoint deck that:

    Explains every product

    Shows diagrams (system, product map)

    Uses simple corporate tone

    🧩 14. Summary

    Principal SimpleInvest brings everything together:

    Connects employer plans + personal investing

    Combines automation + human advice

    Provides one secure digital experience

    Helps people grow retirement wealth — safely and smartly.
